# Welcome to my profile page, my name is Ilya! ðŸ‘‹
### Perhaps you will agree that working with a person with whom you know a little is calm and pleasant. So I want to tell you a little about myself. In short, I am "self-taught". I drew knowledge in the field of web programming from various books, articles and courses on the educational platforms Beonmax and Freecodecamp. I graduated more than 2 years ago, but I still continue to improve my skills and study new technologies.


### At the moment I own the following technologies:
:hash: Basic knowledge: `Html(Html5)` and `CSS(CSS3)`; </br>

:hash: 	Programming languages: `JavaScript`, `PHP`; </br>

:hash:  CMS: `WordPress`, `Joomla`, `Textolite`; </br>

:hash:  `Gulp`, `BEM` and much more. </br>

#### I also have experience in web design development. I know how to work in Figma, Photoshop.
#### I will be glad to work with you) Write me : ilrosch@yandex.ru
